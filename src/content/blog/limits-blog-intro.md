Heyo! Ashley here with another post.
I wasn't too sure what to post for a while, but then I found a topic!

Limits. My new in-development tech forum.
Tbh, I'm not too sure what it's gonna be long-term. maybe an entire Reddit replacement? Or just a small tech forum in the corner of the web? idk. But its a cool project imo.

I'm working on [the API](https://github.com/limit-org/limits-api), and [@Netolysis](https://github.com/netolysis) is currently working on the frontend.

The frontend is in design currently, but our plans look something like this:

A plan for what a post's page will look like/display if its [NSFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work) or got a spoiler. On the left, its got a media scroller. that displays images and videos (possibly audio too as a speaker icon) that go with the post.

This is a mockup for what profiles will look like for users. They may not be able to add stuff like location in the future but I'm open to adding that. The top and bottom are essentially the same besides a check mark and the username/alias being moved a little.

A zoomed in version of the text and pfp:

A landing page mockup.

DEFINATELY gonna change a bit, but I plan for users to not need to be logged in to view posts. Sites that do that are annoying and probably track you everywhere.

I want limits to be friendly to user privacy and for people to use. The content policy is to be completed, but the basis of it is:
 - No media is allowed that contains a significant amount of blood or exteme/severe wounds. Anything gorier than that is not allowed.
 - Nudity is allowed, except sexual nudity or sexual or pornographic content/acts.
 - Glorification of obviously not good things i am not listing here. (yk)
 - Glorification or taking part in swatting = INSTANT user and ip ban.
 - Any content that is very disturbing in nature = either a warn or ban depending on what it is. up to mod discretion.

An AI content filtering system will probably be implemented at some point for detecting basic things like nudity vs. sexual content, _certain_ symbols and bad stuff.

If you want to contribute to Limits, please come talk in [our discord](https://discord.gg/sgYB9bcrA3) and check out [our GitHub](https://github.com/limit-org) too! 
(Any commits done under an [acreiko](https://github.com/acreiko) is me, Ashley. It's an alt-github account.)

And if you can't code or dont want to, just drop in and say "Hi!". Its quite a small group of people at the moment.

I hope you enjoyed this post! If you have any suggestions/improvements (or just wanna talk), contact me by my discord in the bottom right of the page!
