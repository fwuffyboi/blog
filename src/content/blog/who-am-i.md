TL;DR: In short, I'm Ashley. I like music, coding (sometimes) and watching TV shows/films.

The long version:
My name is Ashley, or more commonly, "fwuffyboi" online.
I like programming sometimes. I know python and a little bit of javascript, however its uncommon that I use js.

I watch a lot of TV shows, however, my favourite one so far is ["How to sell drugs online (fast)"](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/88236-how-to-sell-drugs-online-fast) it's a german show on Netflix about two teenagers who turn their failing online ingame item trading shop into a drug selling store. Though, I wont spoil any more, go watch! I promise it will be good. :3
My current favourite film is ["Bullet Train"](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/718930-bullet-train)

My favourite music artists at the time of writing are:
 - [Death Grips](https://genius.com/artists/Death-grips)
 - [Clipping.](https://genius.com/artists/Clipping)
 - [Machine Girl](https://genius.com/artists/Machine-girl)

My favourite albums from those artists are:
 - Death Grips: [Exmilitary](https://genius.com/albums/Death-grips/Exmilitary), [The Money Store](https://genius.com/albums/Death-grips/The-money-store) and [Year of the Snitch](https://genius.com/albums/Death-grips/Year-of-the-snitch) AS WELL AS [Government Plates](https://genius.com/albums/Death-grips/Government-plates). (Essentially half of all their discography, i know ðŸ’€.)
 - Machine Girl: [...Because I'm Young Arrogant and Hate Everything You Stand For](https://genius.com/albums/Machine-girl/Because-im-young-arrogant-and-hate-everything-you-stand-for), [WLFGRL](https://genius.com/albums/Machine-girl/Wlfgrl) and [U-Void Synthesizer](https://genius.com/albums/Machine-girl/U-void-synthesizer)
 - Clipping.: [Visions of Bodies Being Burned](https://genius.com/albums/Clipping/Visions-of-bodies-being-burned), [CLPPNG](https://genius.com/albums/Clipping/Clppng) and also [CLBBNG](https://genius.com/albums/Clipping/Clbbng).

All those artists are of similar genre. And I listen to all of them on a daily basis. If you have any song suggestions, shoot them on over at my discord! (It's at the bottom right of the page, just click!)


I also happen to run 2 servers! I even named them... Anton and Alexis. They're very nice.

Anton currently runs a [spotify listening stat thingy](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify), [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://github.com/NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager) for Alexis and [Homarr](https://github.com/ajnart/homarr).

Alexis runs a lot.
 - A YouTube video downloader: [MeTube](https://github.com/alexta69/metube)
 - A file browser called... [FileBrowser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser)??
 - Bitwarden but not: [VaultWarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden)
 - My TV/Movie/(part-time)Music player! [JellyFin!!](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin)
 - Aaaaaaaaaand [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing) to y'know, sync my things up to my Nas??..

Now, that "NAS" is Alexis. 

Both of my servers run off of a Raspberry Pi 4B. Except Alexis uses an [Argon EON case](https://argon40.myshopify.com/products/argon-eon-pi-nas), which I must say, is very impressive. It currently has 2TB of storage (2x 2TB HDD's) and it is in RAID 1. (Basically RAID 1 just means whatever I put on one drive, goes onto the other, so if a drive breaks, I still have a version of all my data.)

I dont know what else to put here. If anyone who decided to read this has any ideas what I should post next, send a text on discord! (Again, lol, bottom right of the page.)
